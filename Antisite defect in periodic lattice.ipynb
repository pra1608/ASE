    "Problem 1: Antisite defect in periodic lattice [30 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "In lecture 6 notebook [12_ASE_practice.ipynb], we performed an in-class activity (Activity-4), where our task was to create an antisite defect in a 4x4x4 supercell of PbTiO3 unitcell. In that activity, we replaced the position of one Pb atom with that of a nearest-neighboring Ti atom [Pb-Ti antisite defect]. To ensure that the nearest neighbor is on the same side of cell (nearest neighbor could be on the other side of the cell due to periodic boundary conditions), we chose Pb atom close to the center of the supercell.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, we will relax this requirement. That is, we are not allowed to choose only from close to center of the supercell. We have to choose any Pb atom randomly from the entire supercell. Next we need to find nearest-neighboring Ti. Note that the Ti could be on the other-side of the cell. Your job in this activity is to find the nearest Ti atom [use periodic boundary condition (PBC), i.e., atom with direct/fractional/scaled/reduced coordinate (0.2,0.8,0.4) could be moved to (1.2, 0.8,0.4) or (1.2,1.8.1.4) and likewise without any change in the structure]. So, for example, if Pb is at direct-coord (0.90, 0.95, 0.85) and one Ti at direct-coord (0.60, 0.60, 0.55) and another Ti at direct-coord (0.10, 0.10, 0.05) then the second Ti atom is the nearest neighor even though first Ti atom seems closer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caution: All the atoms in the provided perturbed_supercell_PbTiO3_POSCAR file are displaced from their equilirium positions by some random amount. As such, there is only one neighboring Ti with minimum distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: To solve this problem, first select a random Pb atom. Next loop over all Ti atoms. For each Ti atom, check what is the nearest distance of this Ti atom with the chosen Pb atom by considering PBC. For this, shift the Ti atom by [n1*a1 + n2*a2 + n3*a3], where n1,n2,n3 are integers and a1,a2,a3 are lattice vectors and calculate distances using generated cartesian coordinates. Finally for the chosen Pb atom and current Ti atom, the distance would be minimum of all of these [n1*a1 + n2*a2 + n3*a3] Ti-image distances. Note that you need to consider negative n1,n2,n3 as well! Think about what should be range of n1, n2, and n3. "

    "For studying the surface catalytic activities of heterogeneous catalysts, the activity of material is predicted by calculating the adsorption energies of involved reaction species on the catalyst surface. This is acheived by creating a surface/slab of catalytic material and adsorbing reaction species on different surface sites. For modelling of catalytic surface, typically bottom few layers of atoms are fixed to their bulk environment during the relaxation process using constraints. \n",

As such you will see that the vacuum is added in the z-direction."
